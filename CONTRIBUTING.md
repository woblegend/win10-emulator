## 📑 Getting Started

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from main.
2. Make sure your code lints.
3. Use consistent code styling.
4. Issue that pull request!
5. Add a comment describing what you've done.

## 🐛 Report bugs using Github's issues
To submit a bug or an issue, use the github [Issues](https://github.com/sunkanmii/Windows-10-Pro-Emulator/issues) tab to submit one!

## ✍🏾 Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
This is an example of of a bug report, and I think it's not a bad model. Here is another example.

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

* A quick summary and/or background
* Steps to reproduce
  * Be specific!
  * Give sample code if you can. My stackoverflow question includes sample code that anyone with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
* What you expected would happen
* What actually happens
* Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
* People love thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
